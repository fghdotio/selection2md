# selection2md

Convert selected content on a web page to Markdown format. The selection is copied, converted to Markdown, and put back into the clipboard.

The conversion is carried out by [turndown.js](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown). It's inspired by [clipboard2markdown](https://github.com/euangoddard/clipboard2markdown).

## Usage

For Tampermonkey users, you can install the [script](https://github.com/funfungho/selection2md/raw/main/selection2md.user.js) hosted on GitHub and modify the `@match` value to match the sites you want to use it on.
